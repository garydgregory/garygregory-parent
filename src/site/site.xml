     ! Even though the default site.vm template contains code to convert relative links, this is
     ! actually done before the content is passed to the template, for both site:site and site:stage.
     ! Unfortunately, this means that the conversion is done in the context of commons-parent, which
     ! contains the site.xml, rather than in the context of the project being built.
     ! This means that relative URLs are created with an additional ../ prefix.
     ! The work-round is to use a dummy absolute URL that can never be used, and then remove this
     ! as part of the template processing.
     ! See MSITE-559

     ! Similarly href entries are converted before they are passed to the template.
     ! In this case, we want the URL to remain absolute.
     ! The work-round is to use a dummy suffix that is removed by the template.
     ! This is due to be fixed in version 2.3 of the site plugin - see MSITE-159, MSHARED-189
     ! Or use site:stage which does not convert these links ...
